It is a MOOC offered by Dartmouth College on edX.
It's a series of career-oriented courses to develop in-demand skills.
The courses include the following:

    C Programming: Getting Started
    C Programming: Language Foundations
    C Programming: Modular Programming and Memory Management
    Programming: Pointers and Memory Management
    C Programming: Advanced Data Types
    Linux Basics: The Command Line Interface
    C Programming: Using Linux Tools and Libraries


I intend to document the code I'll write as part of assignments from the MOOC, here on github.
